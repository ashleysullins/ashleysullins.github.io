        <h2>About</h2>
        <h4>Hi. I'm Ashley. Nice to meet ya.</h4>
        <p>I've spent the last four years working at tech start ups in the Kansas City area, doing everything from operations to project management to quality assurance testing. During that time, I've been fortunate to work with awesome mentors who have taught me that sofware doesn't work by magic. There's an entire stack of applications working together, making sure that the credit card autopayment you scheduled will actually get paid on that day (and also finding out why it might not). The more I learn, the greater my curiosity becomes about how the technology I use everyday works. </p>
        <p>I love working on small teams with passionate people who want to be the best. If that sounds like your team, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. </p>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <ul class="experience">
          <li><p> <b>Manual Quality Assurance Testing</b> - I like breaking things and then figuring the exact steps of how I broke it. I've tested all the things - over 300 websites, social media applications, iOS and Android mobile applications, a client relationship management system, and business management (POS + CRM + Accounting) software. I make good engineers great and bad engineers quit. </li> </p>
          <li><p> <b>User Experience Testing</b> - Apps built at start ups don't come with requirements, so I also get to be the person who says, "Heyy... guys, this functionality doesn't make much sense. Maybe try this instead?". Whenever I'm testing, I imagine my Grandma attempting to use to use the software. If Granny doesn't get it, it still needs some work.</li><p>
          <li><p> <b>Project Management</b> - Keeping projects organized and on "schedule" since 2013. I get $hit done.</li><p>
          <li><p><b>Technical Support</b> - I love problem solving and figuring out how things work. It's fascinating to learn how clients use software because it helps me become a better tester and developer. </li></p>
          <li><p><b>HTML and CSS</b> - I enjoy making designer's dreams come to life and improving my front end development skills. </li> </p>
